kms activator windows 11
1. Add the installation ID of the valid activation key to the SessionId parameter of the digital ticket (the method is provided by the @asdcorp).
2. Added Office permanent activation ((Ohook is intercepted when Office is opened, and it is still not activated through the system command query, which can be ignored)), refer to the open source project: https://github.com/asdcorp
3. Fix the problem that the installation path of Office 2010/2013 C2R version is incorrect.
4. Automatically detect whether Windows updates are turned on or not (turning off updates may cause digital activation to fail).
5. In intelligent activation, the default activation method for Office is Ohook.
